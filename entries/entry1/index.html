<pre> I stumbled through the city night,                                    full of <em>booze</em>
<br>
                                and <em>leery</em> of the dark streets                                                       that <em>taunt</em>ed me
<br>
      at every corner.
<br>
                  The <em>lofty</em> buildings loomed high above,                                    sprinkled with glowing windows like stars.            Each with a different story.
                              <br><br><br><br><br>
                                                          A costume-<em>theme</em>d house party.
                                                                        <br><br>
                               A patient with a broken <em>tibia</em>.
                                                                        <br>
                                                                             A student writing an essay for <em>class</em> the next morning.
                                                                        <br><br>
                All within theses windows. 
                                                                        <br>
                                                       I looked back down at my shoes hitting the street-lit pavement,                                              and headed home.
